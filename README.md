CS50/problem/2022/python (seems correct)
Part of CS50 Class.
Ran the check50 command, but get incorrect results for reprompting user, though, in the task description, it does say to reprompt.
Also get incorrect result for a input: "9/8/1636" even though it does run correctly on my end: "1636-09-08"
